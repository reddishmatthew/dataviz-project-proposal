## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is a history of [Meteorite Landings](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh/about_data).

The dataset records historical meteorite landings since the year 1880 and the geolocations of their landings, supplied by NASA. 


## Questions & Tasks

1. **GeoLocation Accurate Landings of Each Meteorite**

  - Visualize the latitude and longitude accurate locations of the landings
    of each meteorite. Displaying with opacity the the areas with higher and
    lower effect.

2. **Compare the sizes of the meteorites.**

   - Using varying size that are relative to the mass (g) of each meteorite
     to compare the sizes of each impact.

3. **Chronological Order of Landings.**

   - Display a year counter that works in unison with the animation.
     Throughout the visualization the landings will be displayed
     one by one in consecutive order. Fading out after a period of time
     to reduce clutter.

4. **Display the Class Types of Meteorites.**

   - Visualize through hue the varying classifications of meteorites.
     This will display the common and less common classes.

5. **Compare Meteorite Size and Class Type.**

   - Using both the hue to visualize class types and size to display
     the mass of each meteorite relatively, it will visualize the
     correlation between class and size.

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can put images into here by pasting them into issues.

You can make images into links like this:

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
